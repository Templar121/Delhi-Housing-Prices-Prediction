# Delhi-Housing-Prices-Prediction
In classical Machine Learning and Statistics, Housing Pricing has always been a lucrative venue for application. Based on demographic details a trained Hypothesis (model) can be used to make predictions. This Repository contains the Housing Pricing Prediction on a Delhi Dataset retrieved from Kaggle [1]
## Model Specification
### Model Name - Random Forest Regression.
### Dataset Specification
The Dataset collected from Kaggle is first subjected to data cleaning and pre-processing. The pre-processed data is split into 80% for the training and 20 % for test sets. The model's performance is measured based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R-squared). 
 The model's Actual Price ad predicted prices are given below.
